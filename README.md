# scripts
Scripts i frequently use

## CleanCache
Cleans every cache on Windows. Also runs diskcleanup and disk-defrag. Clears Windows Store cache and flushes ipconfig

## InstallEverything
Installs everything i want on a new Install. Here's a list:
- Newest Powershell
- Thorium (like ungoogled chrome but faster)
- Discord
- Steam
- Notepad-- (light version of Notepadd++)
- Spotify
- NVCleaninstall (for Nvidia users)
- MSI Afterburner
- Opens up a tool by CTT to tweak some things (Uninstalling Edge, Ultimate Power Plan etc.)

I recommend to do a Windows update after this script.
